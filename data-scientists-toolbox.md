# Data Scientist's Toolbox Notes

### The Toolbox 
- To know what sofware a data scientist needs, you need to know what a data scientist would *do*

##### What do data scientists do?
- Define the question
- Define the ideal data set
- Determine what data you can access
- Obtain the data and clean it
- Exploratory data analysis: clustering, plotting, etc
- Statistical prediction/modelling

Language: We're focusing on R!
IDE: RStudio
Primary file type (in this class, extension is .R): R script
Documentation: using R markdown documents. Extension: .Rmd
Version Control: Github and Git

##### Some Important R Functions
- Access help file ```?rnorm``` for a function
- Search help files ```help.search("rnorm") for a function
- Get arguments ```args("rnorm")``` from a function
- Can also type name of function 'rnorm' and get all of the code corresponding to that
function

##### How to ask an R question
- What steps will reproduce the problem?
  - what did you do to get to that error?
- What is the expected output?
- What do you see instead?
- What version of the product (R, packages, etc) are you using?
- What operating system?

##### How to ask a data analysis question
- What is the question you're trying to answer?
- What steps/tools did you use to answer it?
- What did you expect to see?
- What do you see instead?
- What other solutions have you thought about? (So that when you ask the question, 
people trying to help you can try approaches you haven't done)

##### Finding Answers 
- Often the information you need is scattered around and you have to do some hard work to synthesize that information
  - stackoverflow for R
  - crossvalidated for more general questions 
  - google "[data type] R package"
  - data analysis is called differently based on your data type
    - biostats -> medical data
    - data science -> web analytics
    - ML -> data in cs/comp vision
    - NLP -> for data from texts
    - Signal processing -> data from electrical signals
    - Econometrics -> economic data
